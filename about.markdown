<section class="content container my-4" markdown="1">
  I am Christopher, an Electrical Engineering student at TU Delft, currently in the 2nd year of the bachelors. My special interests lay in computer engineering and chip design, robotics and control/automation, and possibly signal processing (still exploring that path!). 

  **Mr_Stoffer** is the online name I've taken on years ago during high school, after an old "friend" called me that for a few days as a joke.
