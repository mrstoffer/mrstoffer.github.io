Welcome to my site! This is the very first post, if you can read this then everything should be in working order!

I've spent a decent chunk of my time during the last week of 2025 to build this website as preparation for my plans in 2026. It's not really done yet, and some of the content definitely still has some gaps to fill. But I think it's in a good enough state that it is ready to be used as part of my grander plan for the next year.

For me, there is a lot of new stuff on the horizon. There are many new activities I want to try out in 2026, exciting projects and courses upcoming in my engineering curriculum, and if the stars align, I might even be able to start a personal adventure abroad in the summer.

It's honestly unreal how much has happened since the start of my EE BSc in 2024, and especially throughout 2025. From starting my first job, to discovering the wonderful world of electrical engineering, to even mentoring my old high school robotics team all the way to the World Cup; it was truly an awesome chapter of my life. Which makes it even more mindblowing that I might be at the start of a new, even more exciting chapter.

Through this blog/site and my social media channels, I hope to document my journey throughout 2026 for myself and others. To process my memories in such a way that in a few years time I can look back at my creations proud and fondly. I hope to see you along my journey as I discover the wonderful opportunities that the next year likely has in store for me. 

But for now, Happy new year!
